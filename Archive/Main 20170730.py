	# below is an example of a good method comment
	#
	# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	#
    # this method implements the evauluation criterea for the clusters of each clutering algorithms
	# criterea:
	#		- 1/2 of the clusters for each result need to be:
	#			- the average silhouette score of the cluster needs to be higher then the silhouette score of all the clusters
	#			  combined
	#			- the standard deviation of the clusters need to be lower than the standard deviation of all the clusters
	#			  combined
	#		- silhouette value for the dataset must be greater than 0.5
    #
    # Requirements:
    # package time
	# package numpy
	# package statistics
	# package sklearn.metrics
    #
    # Inputs:
    # list_cluster_results
    # Type: list
    # Desc: the list of parameters for the clustering object
	# list[x][0] -> type: array; of cluster results by sample in the order of the sample row passed as indicated by the sparse
	#				or dense array
	# list[x][1] -> type: string; the cluster ID with the parameters
	#
    # array_sparse_matrix
    # Type: numpy array
    # Desc: a sparse matrix of the samples used for clustering
    #    
    # Important Info:
    # None
    #
    # Return:
    # object
    # Type: list
    # Desc: this of the clusters that meet the evaluation criterea
	# list[x][0] -> type: array; of cluster results by sample in the order of the sample row passed as indicated by the sparse
	#				or dense array
	# list[x][1] -> type: string; the cluster ID with the parameters
	# list[x][2] -> type: float; silhouette average value for the entire set of data
	# list[x][3] -> type: array; 1 dimensional array of silhouette values for each data sample
	# list[x][4] -> type: list; list of lists, the cluster and the average silhoutte value for each cluster, the orders is sorted 
	#					highest to lowest silhoutte value
	#					list[x][4][x][0] -> int; cluster label
	#					list[x][4][x][1] -> float; cluster silhoutte value
	# list[x][5] -> type: list; a list that contains the cluster label and the number of samples in each cluster
	#					list[x][5][x][0] -> int; cluster label
	#					list[x][5][x][1] -> int; number of samples in cluster list[x][5][x][0]
