    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
    
    this method implements the evauluation criterea for the clusters of each clutering algorithms
    criterea:
            - 1/2 of the clusters for each result need to be:
                - the average silhouette score of the cluster needs to be higher then the silhouette score of all the clusters
                  combined
                - the standard deviation of the clusters need to be lower than the standard deviation of all the clusters
                  combined
            - silhouette value for the dataset must be greater than 0.5
    
    Requirements:
    package time
    package numpy
    package statistics
    package sklearn.metrics
    
    Inputs:
    list_cluster_results
    Type: list
    Desc: the list of parameters for the clustering object
    list[x][0] -> type: array; of cluster results by sample in the order of the sample row passed as indicated by the sparse
                   or dense array
    list[x][1] -> type: string; the cluster ID with the parameters
    
    array_sparse_matrix
    Type: numpy array
    Desc: a sparse matrix of the samples used for clustering
        
    Important Info:
    None
    
    Return:
    object
    Type: list
    Desc: this of the clusters that meet the evaluation criterea
    list[x][0] -> type: array; of cluster results by sample in the order of the sample row passed as indicated by the sparse
                   or dense array
    list[x][1] -> type: string; the cluster ID with the parameters
    list[x][2] -> type: float; silhouette average value for the entire set of data
    list[x][3] -> type: array; 1 dimensional array of silhouette values for each data sample
    list[x][4] -> type: list; list of lists, the cluster and the average silhoutte value for each cluster, the orders is sorted 
                       highest to lowest silhoutte value
                       list[x][4][x][0] -> int; cluster label
                       list[x][4][x][1] -> float; cluster silhoutte value
    list[x][5] -> type: list; a list that contains the cluster label and the number of samples in each cluster
                       list[x][5][x][0] -> int; cluster label
                       list[x][5][x][1] -> int; number of samples in cluster list[x][5][x][0]
